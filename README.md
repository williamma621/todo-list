# todo-list

Simple Todo List Python Program

todo-list-v1 stores all user data inside the python file itself, but large amounts of user data may cause errors, making the user not being able to add new data.
todo-list-v2 creates "~todo-list.json" file in the same folder and stores user data in it, and it could store large amounts of data with no problem.
